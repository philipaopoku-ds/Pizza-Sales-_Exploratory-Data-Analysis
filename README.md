# 🍕Pizza Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a year’s worth of pizza sales data from a fictitious pizza place.  
The dataset includes order information, pizza details, and ingredients.  
The analysis provides insights into **revenue trends, customer purchasing behavior, and pizza performance**.

The project demonstrates how to:
- Clean and merge multiple CSV files into one dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**  
- Generate business insights such as **top-selling pizzas, peak sales hours, and underperforming items**

## 📂 Dataset Description
The analysis uses four CSV files:

| File Name          | Description                                                        |
